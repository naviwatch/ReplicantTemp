===Mod Description===

This mod includes some features from the VT1 Different Bots (or Xq's bots):
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2262580549

The Replicant Bots project is a development of the previous version, which is spiritually a direct port of VT1 Different Bots into VT2. The current goal is to make bots perform as well as competitive human players at cataclysm level and above, and in addition try to make bots behave like human players.

The Bit Of Bots Improvements mod is integrated into this mod to cover the aspects of bots that I (Vernon) haven't dealt with so far:

This mod CANNOT be used together with Bot Improvements - Combat and Bit Of Bots Improvements as the amount of overlapping codes is huge. As a (probably unsatisfying) solution, functionality from the other mods have been built into this mod (for now).

===Settings Explanation===

Here describes settings that are not immediately obvious.

'Melee Attack Selection': Determines whether bots choose (to spam) light attack or heavy attack in a certain combat situation. No melee combo nor push attack supported for now.
Under which, 'Bot Improvements - Combat' is mostly light spam unless the heavy attack has vastly better crowd control or armor damage, this reduces bots' damage taken from hordes in the original mod.
'Default Game Settings' selects attacks based on the attack's damage profile (cleave and armor damage etc.), targeted enemy type and number of enemies in melee.
'Mod Authors' Settings' is default game settings with some tweaks to a few number of weapons.

===Recommended Settings===

All enabled except 'Bots Drink Potions' which is up to preference.
All healing settings set to 'when wounded'.
'Melee Attack Selection' set to either default or 'Mod Authors' Settings'.

===Bot Tier List===

Here lists bot careers in terms of their performance compared to a competitive human players using the same career in the current version of the mod, based on personal tests.

Good bots:
- Mercenary
- Grail Knight
- Ranger Veteran
- Ironbreaker
- Waystalker
- Sister of the Thorn
- Witch Hunter Captain
- Bounty Hunter
- Zealot
- Warrior Priest of Sigmar
- Unchained

Average bots:
- Slayer
- Battle Wizard

Bad bots:
- Foot Knight
- Handmaiden

Unknown:
- Huntsman
- Outcast Engineer
- Shade
- Pyromancer

Known good bot weapons:
- Any ranged weapon that can headshot with conservative shooter

Known bad bot weapons:
- Theoretically, ranged weapons that require long charging time are bad, but I haven't tested many options except Bolt Staff, which is dominated by handguns / crossbows etc.
- Trollhammer Torpedo with conservative shooter, targets keep getting killed or staggered by other bots, might work if there is one bot only
- Briar Javelin on cataclysm, bots fail to calculate trajectory for faraway targets
- Deepwood Staff if you have other bots with conservative shooter, since it wastes ammo for other bots, and currently bot does not use it aggressively against elites
